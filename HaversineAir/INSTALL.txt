HSAirXPL Plugin 4.7  
(c) 2013-2017 Haversine Ltd

Hardware and Software Requirements: 
===================================

In order to run and use this plugin you need: 

- An Intel computer with a running copy of X-Plane version 11, 10 or 9.
- An Ethernet (wired or WiFi) interface on the computer configured for a 
local IP network. 
- A WiFi network connected to the computer so that the iPhone/iPad/iPod can
  receive the data broadcasted by the plugin. 
- The devices must all be on the same subnet and layer 2 broadcast domain. 

Installation Instructions: 
==========================

Note: If you have a previous version of the AirTrackXPL or HSAIRXPL installed 
under the Resources/plugins sub-folder of X-Plane, 
(e.g. HSAIRXPL-4.6-XXX.xpl), delete it first.

For X-Plane 11 copy the ENTIRE folder named HaversineAir to the Resources/plugins
X-Plane folder.

In older versions of X-Plane (9) which do not support the compact universal plugin
directory layout you may need to configure the corresponding 32 bit individually
to Resources/plugins directly and rename it to something like hsair.xpl

That's all.
 
Support for the MCP and EFIS PRO and EL from CPFlight
=====================================================

As of version 4.3, this plugin also acts as a driver for the MCP-EL, MCP-PRO
and corresponding primary EFIS units of CPFlight. 

It replaces the manufacturer's driver and replaces the previously release 
plugin CPFXPL for Mac available at x-plane.org. 

The cpflight part only works if the words CPFLIGHT-SERIAL-PORT= are found in 
the config file.

On Mac if you have a CPFLight MCP it should appear as /dev/cu.usbserial...
so create hsairxpl.cfg in the Resources/plugins/HaversineAir folder of
X-Plane and put one of:

CPFLIGHT-SERIAL-PORT=AUTO

or 

CPFLIGHT-SERIAL-PORT=/dev/cu.usb...

On Linux you will probably need to specify the device. Create  hsairxpl.cfg
in the Resources/plugins/HaversineAir folder of X-Plane and add a line such as
CPFLIGHT-SERIAL-PORT=/dev/serial-port to it.

On Windows, create hsairxpl in the Resources/plugins/HaversineAir folder of
X-Plane and add a line such as:

CPFLIGHT-SERIAL-PORT=COMn

where COMn is the serial port of the MCP.

Troubleshooting: 
================

If your X-Plane flight doesn't appear on your iPod/iPad/iPhone you can try
to find the root cause of the problem. Below are some suggestions of things
you can do: 

1. Look at the Log.txt file under the X-Plane folder to see if the plugin
loaded successfully. 

2. The plugin will send UDP packets to the local network to address 
239.224.224.1 on port 2424 for AirTrack, 2425 for AirFMC and 2426 for AirEFB.

From UDP port 59000 of the computer <---> To UDP port 2424, 2425 or 2426 of
the corresponding app.

Make sure these are being sent. On Mac or Linux you can use for example: 

	# sudo tcpdump port 2424

	Or for the WiFi interface of your mac: 
	# sudo tcpdump -i en1 port 2424 

	Or on Linux:  

	# sudo tcpdump -i eth1 port 2424 

You should see packets going out on that interface. If not, something is 
wrong with the plugin; if yes, something is wrong with the App.

The plugin attempts to bind to port 59000 so UDP packets will go:

Press CTRL-C to quit.

3. Make sure you have your iDevice connected to the same WiFi IP subnet 
of where packets are being sent out. 

4. If you have multiple network interfaces, it may be that the plugin 
is loaded but is sending packets to the wrong interface. One example of 
this is if you have a mac with a wired Internet connection and you are 
using Internet sharing to share to the Wireless Interface. 

In this case the packets sent by the plugin will go out on the interface 
that has the best route to the destination multicast address 239.224.224.1 
which, by default, is where the default Internet route is. 

In order to overcome this problem you need to route these multicast packets
onto the right interface. 

Unfortunately there is no easy way in which we can do this from the plugin 
because that would require for it (or X-Plane) to run with root privileges, 
so to fix this you need to apply a manual fix yourself: 

Just open a terminal window and type on the mac: 

	# sudo route add -host 239.224.224.1/32 -interface en1

Or on Linux: 

	/sbin/route add -host 239.224.224.1 netmask 255.255.255.255 eth1

Replace en1/eth1 by your WiFi Interface. 

Note: You will have to do this everytime you restart, or you may install 
this command on a startup script to be persistent. 

5. Try restarting the App in the iPhone/iPad/iPod by double clicking on 
the home button and killing it. 

=========

6. As of 2.2.2, a new way of targetting your iDevice has been introduced.

If all else fails, check the IP address of your iPad/iPhone/iPod and 
insert it in the address field under HSAir -> Settings menu option. 

This tells X-Plane to only send packets to that IP address, but on 
the other hand you are in control of the IP address to which it sends
packets. 

The only downside of this approach is that you can only use one device
connected to X-Plane, and that if your device changes its IP address 
(via DHCP for instance) you will need to keep changing it in X-Plane.
